Lets get started. </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>Did everyone get a chance to look at the content that we posted?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sambhavi Chandrashekar</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>yes, briefly</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>If you didn&#39;t we posted up a couple of links to sample clips that we have been working with</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Bruce Naokwegijig</td><td>I&#39;m still trying to get it.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>these clips contain examples of video description in 3rd person and 1st person</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sambhavi Chandrashekar</td><td>Like I wrote, everyone can even now open ATutor in another browser window and have a look</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>also in the previous workshop, we did a screen movie of the software used</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>this software can be used in a live and production environment</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>We also posted the process that we have been exploring</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sambhavi Chandrashekar</td><td>Do you mean you used the same software for both Live Describe and Audio Description of video?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>because Smiley Guy Studios is producing the video description in house</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>i can see why first person would be much more difficult</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>what this means is that they have control over who writes the script</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>i did like it better though</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>how it is recorded and produced.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>the other really important benefit is that the video description track </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">system</td><td>User Smriti Dev has logged in.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>is mixed with the original audio track in the master mix</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>that means that volume levels are controlled for all audio sources</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>oh, so it can&#39;t be pulled out?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>Cindy, no they are still separate audio tracks</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>but the mix is done at the master so that quality is</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>controlled there</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>normally video description that is done after the show is made is added onto a copy of the master</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>and this makes audio level control more difficult</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>does that make sense?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>yes, i understand</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>the real key is we control the script and voice</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">system</td><td>User Chris Wemigwans has logged in.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>in addition because audio description is interpreted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>someone must decide what stay in and what goes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>we think that this is best done by the creative team with content knowledge and expertise on what they are trying to convey to an audience</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>thats where the challange starts</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>i would agree</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>a third party is really taking educated guesses</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>i absolutely agree with this</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>however, adding this layer of production to the schedule has posed problems</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>yes, this is much different than the live description because that is more &#39;factual&#39;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>It&#39;s a big can of worms</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>but i would say this is much easier as its happening in post production</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>Because what you are trying to do is provide sound dimension</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>And this doesn&#39;t end at dialogue, or a quick story of the set and setting</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>indeed, faisal</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sambhavi Chandrashekar</td><td>Is it easier to do third person than first person?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>Also ensuring the intent of the DV script is the same as the original writer is difficult </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>Yes it is. When you add in the real talent you are stepping more in to the fictional world and want to keep it in line with the program</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>The other problem is this is so new the unions don&#39;t understand it</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sambhavi Chandrashekar</td><td>It is interesting to note that people prefer entertainment to more factual description</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>i feel there is a limitation in a software where you can or cannot do certain things in creative ways</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>I think it depends on the genre of program but people like to be entertained! </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">system</td><td>User Jennison Asuncion has logged in.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>It&#39;s not the software as much as the writing, recording, editing and mixing</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>Perhaps with a factual description, the audience must then &quot;translate&quot; into the fiction space</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>i don&#39;t understand the union dilema: what&#39;s that about?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>While the entertaining version takes you right there</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sambhavi Chandrashekar</td><td>I mean they thought first person was less believable but more entertaining</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>If you work with union talent you have to work with ACTRA and they have set rates which are unaffordable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>There is also the writer&#39;s union, if the writer is WGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>so in the third person option, the talent wouldn&#39;t have to be union?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>i have a question here, why there is a need to add audio description?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>That is correct. It could be anyone (with a good voice I hope)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>regardless to first person or 2nd person</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>I think the unions are really going to miss out this opportunity with the new CRTC mandates for audio description</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>Faisal you ask a good question</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>most producers do not consider what happens when you have an audio only track to listen</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>I think that if you try and watch a show without the visuals, you miss a lot</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>however, that is what our subjects have told us</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jennison Asuncion</td><td>Sorry, I was crashed out of the chat. I just now listened to the demo of the fight scene with the female voice and the first-person. As someone who has taken advantage of voice description at movies,</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>that may not be true for everyone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>i saw the video,s they are very well designed and developed and have all the entertaining components</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>if a show is made with an audio only audience in mind then it probably isn&#39;t necessary</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>aka radio dramas</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>here you go, so i think the voice over is still missing the visual description.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>its not doing anything ACCEPT, adding some extra video noise... (i think)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jennison Asuncion</td><td>my personal preference is the third-person description. It seemed less confusing since it was a different voice other than the actors. </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>sorry audio noise</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>actually Faisal, I think that what is missing is the pieces of the narrative that are represented in only the visual domain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>and there is quite a bit of it these days</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>yeah i like it, its more casual, more creative</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>it is not necessary the visual information itself but what it contributes to the unfolding of the story</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sambhavi Chandrashekar</td><td>Jennison, you have a good point there</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cindy Schatkoski</td><td>i personally also thought that the third person was easier to understand</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>It is completely subjective and that is what we&#39;ve learned in our research</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>Jennison you have a reaction that some people have</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>and one of the things that we really need to is a longitudinal study to see whether there is a change</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>yes, Deborah you are right, audience missing the experience</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>over time</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>I think it depends where and why you are consuming the audio description</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>most people have only been exposed to 3rd person </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>Have there been any considerations to expressing the &quot;missing&quot; visuals with additional sound effects, rather than description?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>and will find the 3rd person more trustworthy</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>as a result</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>we are not sure whether this is a function of the narrative form or of the conventions people know</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>We tried creating a sound library but it just made the audio track even more confusing</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>We also want to try and understand what people think is entertaining</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>a subject that we discussed last week but needs more discussion and thought</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>kind of a film studies thing</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>but one that is important</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>ok i&#39;d be interested to hear results of that discussion</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>we also have the luxury and time to try and study some of these issues without the deadlines and pressure to deliver content</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>We think as audio description the 3rd person works but as a potential standalone commercial product may need the added layer of storytelling that 1st person offers</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>so people&#39;s opinions here are very, very valuable</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">system</td><td>User Lindsay MacDonald has logged in.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>In terms of audience testing, what was the environment?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>What Jonas is talking about is a potential business case for audio description</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>where a totally new product can be made available to all consumers</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jennison Asuncion</td><td>One of the challenges for folks like myself who are blind, if using the first-person is, this person speaking dialogue at the moment, or is that description? </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>that is the audio-only track that can be listened to in the car, subway, whatever</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>thats a good point,,, you are adding another content level on top of orginal script... wonder if you get the audio description from the same director </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>however, this must be entertaining</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>We kind of wanted to make it seemless Jenn so you wouldn&#39;t know the difference</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>We tried to have the same folks work on the description as the rest of the show but it is challenging schedule-wise</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">system</td><td>User Chris Wemigwans has logged out.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>right, other wise you guys should need to work with really good script writer/ entertainer</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>and one that has been trained on each piece of content</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>But Jonas is saying that would cause union/budget issues</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>exactly Faisal. And that is where the unions factor in becuase the best are usually members</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>while the script writer/director/editor, etc of the show already have the intimate knowledge</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>i mean, i feels... this comes down to the&quot; person&quot; who is adding this layer..</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>i.c</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>Faisal, there are at least 3 or 4 people involved</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>can you get un-union members</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>it is not usually only 1 person like it is for captioning</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>Of course. But most working actors/writers are in the union. </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>unfortunately video description is rather bogged down by the model used by closed captioning</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>Right now, description is handled by 3rd party providers and they do not use union talent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jennison Asuncion</td><td>One of the things I like about audio desc in theaters is the ability to shut it off by taking off the headphones and putting them back on, when I need describing. Is the on/off functionality built-in </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>I think we are trying to find ways to avoid that</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>because video description is interpreted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>so its more like a logistic issues, rather then a program??</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>Jenn, you can do that on TV as well</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sambhavi Chandrashekar</td><td>How does use of first person impact rights and ownership?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>Faisal it is not really only logistics</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>it is business (financial), creative and logistics</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">system</td><td>User Chris Wemigwans has logged in.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>Sam, that is a good question</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>and one that must be addressed carefully</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>first person may be a separate character giving his/her own perspective</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>the 3rd person option has the same issues but no one has been paying attention</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>becuase it has been farmed out like closed captioning</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Jonas Diamond</td><td>With non-union talent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>anastasia any thoughts?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>I&#39;m interested in participating is future testing, in particular on the ipod platform</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>or bruce?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>ah, Deborah this is wonderful</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>as part of the Culturall project we will be making a set of </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>1st person versions of 3 shows</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>is this a user perference to select first person or 3rd person ?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>and delivering them as podcasts, etc.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>I want to run a long term study for people to spend some time with the content and video description style</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>Great...include me please</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>for the study, Faisal, there will be both available</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>and we will have people in both groups and see how they fair</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>one of the things that we are working on is figuring out the method</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Anastasia Cheetham</td><td>I think software to allow peer description is great as a tool to increase the amount of description out ther</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Faisal Anwar</td><td>interesting..</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>to test people</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Fels</td><td>so far researchers have used multiple choice tests </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deborah Hession</td><td>Is it a &quot;contest&quot;
